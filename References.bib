abstract = {This paper introduces py-amr2fred, a Python library that converts natural language text into OWL-compliant RDF Knowledge Graphs (KGs) through an advanced pipeline integrating Large Language Models, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing and semantic enrichment. Designed for scalability and flexibility, the library addresses limitations in existing solutions and facilitates seamless integration into diverse applications. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we present MusicBO, a domain-specific KG capturing the historical, cultural, and relational aspects of musical heritage. Constructed from a multilingual corpus, MusicBO leverages the pipeline’s capabilities for text processing, AMR parsing, RDF transformation, and quality assurance via back-translation validation. The resulting graph, comprising over 531,000 triples, is publicly accessible and serves as a resource for education, research, and digital storytelling in cultural heritage. Additionally, we propose an intrinsic evaluation method for the quality assessment of the generated KGs, leveraging Open Knowledge Extraction motifs. A manually curated benchmark dataset complements this evaluation framework, providing a valuable resource for future research in text-to-KG construction. The contributions of this work underscore the potential of py-amr2fred in advancing automated, scalable, and domain-independent KG generation.},

Recently, many GNN-based EA methods are proposed and show decent performance improvements on several public datasets. However, existing GNN-based EA methods inevitably inherit poor interpretability and low efficiency from neural networks. Motivated by the isomorphic assumption of GNN-based methods, we successfully transform the cross-lingual EA problem into an assignment problem. Based on this re-definition, we propose a frustratingly Simple but Effective Unsupervised entity alignment method (SEU) without neural networks. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that our proposed unsupervised approach even beats advanced supervised methods across all public datasets while having high efficiency, interpretability, and stability."

Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.},

Due to the importance of the concept of multimodality in the mixture framework, unimodal beta and gamma densities are used as mixture components, leading to a flexible modeling approach. Accordingly, a mode-based parameterization of the components is provided. A partitional clustering method, named \$\$k\$\$-bumps, is also proposed; it is used as an ad hoc initialization strategy in the EM algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation of the mixture parameters. The performance of the \$\$k\$\$-bumps algorithm as an initialization tool, in comparison to other common initialization strategies, is evaluated through some simulation experiments. Finally, two real applications are presented.},

For all its benefits, however, the Gaussian mixture model poses problems when the data is skewed or contains outliers. Because of this, methods have been developed over the years for handling skewed data, and fall into two general categories. The first is to consider a mixture of more flexible skewed distributions, and the second is based on incorporating a transformation to near normality. Although these methods have been compared in their respective papers, there has yet to be a detailed comparison to determine when one method might be more suitable than the other.
